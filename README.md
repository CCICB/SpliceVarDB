# SpliceVarDB

Welcome to the SpliceVarDB repository!

## Overview

Here, we present **SpliceVarDB**, a comprehensive database of variants functionally demonstrated to affect (or not affect) splicing. SpliceVarDB aims to accelerate the diagnostic process for individuals with rare genetic diseases by consolidating information about functionally validated splice-altering variants into a central, accessible repository. This online database enables researchers to quickly access and evaluate previously validated variants, reducing the need to validate suspected variants of interest.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Front-end Code**: The code for the front-end of the [SpliceVarDB website](https://splicevardb.org).
- **Publication Data**: The data and code used to generate the figures in the paper, located in the `publication_data` folder.

## Variants Information

Please note that this repository does not contain information about the variants present in SpliceVarDB. You can download this information directly from the [SpliceVarDB website](https://splicevardb.org).
